# Gynaptic [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wagenaartje/gynaptic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wagenaartje/gynaptic)
Gynaptic is an architecture-free [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) library with implementations to create [genetic neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution). It gives the user the ability to create train neurol networks with evolutionary algorithms with just a few lines of code. The library is constantly updated with new mutation, crossover and selection methods. Gynaptics' main neural network code comes from the library [Synaptic](https://github.com/cazala/synaptic) by [Juan Cazala](https://github.com/cazala). Gynaptic will stay up to date with Synaptic's improvements as much as possible.

What Gynaptic adds to Synaptic:
- an easy-to-use genetic algorithm function
- 7 mutation methods
- 4 crossover methods
- 1 selection method
- 2 generation methods
- 3 squashing functions
- **brain**, which can contain networks, layers & neurons

Improvements:
- `to/fromJSON()` for layers & neurons
- `merge()` networks
- `disconnect()` networks, layers & neurons
- project neurons to networks, layers & vice versa
- overall bugfixes & time improvement

Examples
- [Solve an XOR](https://wagenaartje.github.io/gynaptic/examples/xor/)

# Usage
Head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/wagenaartje/gynaptic/wiki) for documentation.

For the browser, embedding this code makes life easier:
```javascript
Neuron = gynaptic.Neuron;
Evolution = gynaptic.Evolution;
Trainer = gynaptic.Trainer;
Methods = gynaptic.Methods;
Layer = gynaptic.Layer;
Network = gynaptic.Network;
Brain = gynaptic.Brain;
Architect = gynaptic.Architect;
```

# Example
This is an example of the creation and loop of a genetic neural network. The goal of this genetic algorithm is too create a population that will output a value that is as high as possible (=`1`) when inputted `0`. Please note that this is just an example, and this problem is much easier to 'solve' by backpropagating.

```javascript
// Create the evolutionary algorithm
var GNN = new Evolution({
  size: 50,
  elitism: 5,
  mutationRate: 0.05,
  networkSize = [1,4,1],
  mutationMethod: [Methods.Mutation.MODIFY_RANDOM_BIAS, Methods.Mutation.MODIFY_RANDOM_WEIGHT],
  crossOverMethod: [Methods.Crossover.UNIFORM, Crossover.AVERAGE],
  selectionMethod: [Methods.Selection.FITNESS_PROPORTIONATE],
  fitnessFunction: function(network){
     return Math.round(network.activate([0]) * 200);
  }
});

// Loop the evolution process until a certain average score is reached
var notFinished = true;;
while(notFinished){
  GNN.evaluate();
  if(GNN.getAverage() > 190){
    notFinished = false;
  }

  GNN.select();
  GNN.crossOver();
  GNN.mutate();
  GNN.replace();
};
```
